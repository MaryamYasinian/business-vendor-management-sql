# business-vendor-management-sql
My SQL queries explore a vendor and employee management database. This project shows relational queries across vendor, employee, order, and organizational tables to extract business insights.
In my SQL queries, I have focused on the following:
- Identifying vendor contact persons
- Retrieving vendor departments and employees
- Querying orders and order items
- Calculating order totals
- Viewing employee references, certificates, and department assignments
- Exploring company–position relationships
